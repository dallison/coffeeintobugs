Series of computer based articles

This is a series of article that cover various retro computer subjects.  They
are also posted on LinkedIn.

I'm writing another C compiler for fun.  This one is targeting RISC-V, 6502 and Aarch64.
This series of articles covers various subjects including:

* Floating point
* Memory allocation
* Formatted output
* Standard I/O

This is just for fun and I hope that it's interesting.
